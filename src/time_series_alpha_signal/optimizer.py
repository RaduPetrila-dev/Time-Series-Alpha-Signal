    """Scale weights to ensure the L1 norm does not exceed ``max_leverage``.

    For each date the gross leverage is computed as the sum of absolute
    weights.  If this exceeds the allowed ``max_leverage`` the entire
    weight vector is scaled down proportionally.  Otherwise weights are
    returned unchanged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    weights : DataFrame
        Portfolio weights with datetime index and asset columns.
    max_leverage : float, default 1.0
        Maximum allowable gross exposure per day (Î£|weights|).

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        Scaled weights respecting the leverage constraint.
